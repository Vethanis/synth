# synth

A WIP synthesizer using RtMidi and portaudio. Currently it just spits two saw waves out and lists any midi note-on or note-off events.

## Dependencies
C++11 compiler
RtMidi is included as well as binaries for portaudio
UNIX will want to install those libraries using a package manager. 

## Building
use CMake, or ./compile.sh
